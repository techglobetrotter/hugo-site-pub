I\u0026rsquo;ve been working with AWS since 2016, and specialize in Amazon EKS, infrastructure automation, and container orchestration at scale.\nüõ†Ô∏è What I Do Design \u0026amp; Automate: I build production-grade cloud and Kubernetes platforms using AWS-native tools, Terraform, Boto3, and GitOps with ArgoCD. Simplify the Complex: I enjoy distilling tricky DevOps/Kubernetes setups into reusable, production-ready blueprints and documenting them for my teams ‚Äî and now, for you. Tinker \u0026amp; Experiment: Whether it‚Äôs Raspberry Pi projects, AI/ML for logs, or self-hosted apps, I enjoy practical side quests. Share \u0026amp; Help: This blog is my way of giving back to the tech community by writing down things that I wish I had found when I needed them. üß™ What You\u0026rsquo;ll Find Here How-To Guides: Precise, action-oriented solutions with code Kubernetes + Cloud Automation: Real-world patterns, not Hello Worlds Side Projects: From home automation to predictive ML models Occasional Philosophy: Because sometimes, even DevOps engineers ponder about Shiva üòÑ ‚òï Let‚Äôs Connect If something here helps you, consider sharing the post ‚Äî or drop me a line. I believe in simplifying, automating, and sharing knowledge, and I‚Äôm just getting started.\nThanks for visiting. üôè\n","permalink":"https://www.techglobetrotter.com/about/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"-hello-im-viswanath--a-tech-explorer-with-a-purpose\"\u003eüëã Hello, I\u0026rsquo;m Viswanath ‚Äî a Tech Explorer with a Purpose\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWelcome to \u003cstrong\u003eTechGlobetrotter\u003c/strong\u003e ‚Äî a personal space where I document real-world, hands-on technical content shaped by years of experience across IT, cloud, and DevOps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith over \u003cstrong\u003e17 years in IT\u003c/strong\u003e and having started my journey deep in the Linux trenches, I\u0026rsquo;ve since transitioned into building and managing complex cloud-native environments.
